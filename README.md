# extra-sounds
The "Extra Sounds" add-on allows you to assign sounds to events in your Firefox browser. This add-on can be a replacement for the outdated Navigational sounds.

Several events are currently supported:

* Start navigation - a sound is played when a page starts loading.
* Complete navigation - the sound is played when the page has been fully loaded.
* New download - the sound is played when a new file is added to the download list.
* Download complete - the sound is played when any of the downloads have been completed.
* Error downloading - the sound is played if an error occurred while downloading the file.


## Install

You can install this add-on from the Firefox add-on store: (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/extra-sounds/)
